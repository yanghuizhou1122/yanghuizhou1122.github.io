I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Center for Orthopaedic Biomechanics](https://ritchieschool.du.edu/research-innovation/biomedical-devices/center-orthopaedic-biomechanics), [University of Denver](https://www.du.edu/), specializing in **computational orthopaedic biomechanics**. My research focuses on applying **finite element methods** to address **clinically relevant questions**, including joint mechanics, bone remodeling, and implant stability, with the goal of **understanding joint biomechanics**, **improving implant performance**, and **optimizing surgical techniques**. Over the past ten years at the center, I have built extensive expertise in orthopaedic biomechanics, computational modeling, and finite element analysis. 

Current Research
======
My current projects include **developing and validating computational models** for orthopaedic implant evaluation across **multiple joint systems** (hip, knee, spine, etc.); simulating lower limb activities to assess **implant kinematic performance**; assess **capsule-musle contributions** to hip joint stability and **dislocation risk** after total hip arthroplasty; Collaborating industry partners on **implant design optimization and clinical evaluation**; supporting surgical planning, prototype testing, and design iteration through **biomechanical simulation**.
