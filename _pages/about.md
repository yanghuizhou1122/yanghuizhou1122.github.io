I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Center for Orthopaedic Biomechancis](https://ritchieschool.du.edu/research-innovation/biomedical-devices/center-orthopaedic-biomechanics), [University of Denver](https://www.du.edu/), specializing in **computational orthopaedic biomechanics**. My research is focused on using **finite element methods** to investigate **clinically relevant issues**, such as joint mechanics, bone remodeling, and implant stability, with the goal of improving implant performance and optimizing current surgical techniques. Have been working in the Center for more than 8 years, I have accumulated plenty of knowledge and developed expert skills in orthopaedic biomechanics, computational modeling, and finite element analysis. 

Current Research
======
My current work includes developing and valdiating computational mdeols for experiment devices, implants, and human tissues; simulating lower limb activties and assessing the **implant kinematic performance**; evlauating and comparing the **fixation stability** for novel TKA/UKA/THA designs; testing implant designs and prototypes under **physiological conditions** and give suggestions for improvement; answering surgeons' concerns by **simulating potenential sugical plans** and technique concepts.
