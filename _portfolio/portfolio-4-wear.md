### Porject description
The cost and time efficiency of computational wear simulations may enable the optimization of total knee replacements for the reduction of polyethylene wear, thereby potentially improving the long term success of total knee replacements. However, previously existing computational wear models have not demonstrated the necessary level of accuracy in order to be utilized for the wear optimization of total knee replacements. This project aimed to predict the polyethylene wear in TKA for novel implant designs by using a new computational wear model which considered the effect of lubrication, protein denaturation, time dependent molecular direction, and energy dissipation.
