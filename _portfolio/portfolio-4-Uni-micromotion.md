### Porject description
Micromotion exceeding 150μm at the implant-bone interface may prevent bone formation and limit fixation after cementless knee arthroplasty. Understanding the critical parameters impacting micromotion is required for optimal implant design, patient selection, and clinical performance. However, few studies have focused on unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). In this study, we assessed the impacts of implant alignment, bone properties, and implant design factors on implant-bone (both tibial and femoral) interface micromotions for a novel cementless UKA design during a series of activities of daily living. Three previously validated knee models for predicting cementless micromotions were loaded with design-specific kinematics/loading to simulate gait, deep knee bending, and stair descent. The implant-bone micromotion and the corresponding porous surface area ideal for bone ingrowth (micromotion<50µm) were estimated and compared between different models to quantify the impact of each factor.
