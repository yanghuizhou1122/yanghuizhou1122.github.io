### Abstract
Initial stability of cementless femoral stems after hip revision arthroplasty is crucial to restore hip biomechanics and ensure durable fixation. Various implant designs utilize different features to improve the axial and rotational stability in patients with proximal femoral defects. This study aimed to develop an experimental-computational framework for evaluating the fixation stability of novel cementless hip revision implants during activities of daily living. 

### Methods
Two cementless revision femoral stems were evaluated: RECLAIM Modular is a modular femoral system with a press-fit, splined, and tapered distal stem, RECLAIM Monobloc is a monobloc version of the same implant with additional splines between the primary splines, referred to as RECLAIM Advanced Splines (RAS), for enhancing cortical contact (Fig.1a). Each leg of a cadaveric lower limb specimen was broached to size for a primary implant to simulate a femoral defect, reamed, then implanted with RECLAIM Modular on one side and RECLAIM Monobloc on the contralateral side. The denuded femurs were potted into fixtures and mounted into an AMTI VIVO to simulate gait and stair descent (Fig.1b). Experimental boundary conditions were derived from OrthoLoad database (force-control for anterior-posterior, medial-lateral, and superior-inferior degrees of freedom). Relative displacements between the proximal exposed implant-bone interface were recorded using a digital image correlation system.

Finite element models of the specimen were developed in Abaqus/Standard from computed tomography (CT) scans (Fig.1b). Implant alignments were reconstructed using surface models of the implant and bone obtained from optical scans. The models were loaded with the boundary conditions from the experiment. The proximal implant-bone relative displacements were predicted and compared with the experimental measurements. After validation, virtual defects were added to the bone models to simulate different levels of bone loss (Paprosky Classifications Type-I, -II, and -IIIA) (Fig.1c). The two designs were then implanted into the same femur models and evaluated using the same activity loading. Implant-bone interface micromotions were investigated and compared. The models were additionally tested by applying a 10Nm torque and 1500N axial force to the implants to evaluate the axial and rotational stability of the two designs, respectively. The corresponding implant rotation/subsidence and maximum bone strain energy density (SED) across the femurs were compared. Uncertainty bounds for the predictions were generated by perturbing the interference fit on the primary splines from 0-100µm.

###Results 
The average root-mean-square differences and corresponding correlations between the measured and predicted proximal implant-bone displacements were 7.9µm(7.0%)/0.02°(7.6%) and 0.93, respectively (Fig.2). For all evaluated bone defect types, the peak interface micromotions predicted for RECLAIM Modular was on average of 17.4µm (28.4%) larger than those predictions for RECLAIM Monobloc (Fig.3a). For rotational and axial stability tests, the rotation/subsidence of RECLAIM Monobloc were 15.4%/28.2% smaller than RECLAIM Modular (Fig.3b). The corresponding maximum Standard Error of Difference (SED) across the femur was 47.4%/89.9% smaller for RECLAIM Monobloc (Fig.3c).

###Conclusion
Overall, RECLAIM Monobloc showed better stability than RECLAIM Modular, especially in the case of Type-III defects. This was because RECLAIM Monobloc had relatively longer splines due to the monobloc design and RAS  between the primary splines, which increased contact area with the bone, distributed the contact forces, and thereby reduced the implant rotation and subsidence motions.
