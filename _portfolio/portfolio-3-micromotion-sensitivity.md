### Project description
Micromotion exceeding 150Âµm at the implant-bone interface may prevent bone formation and limit fixation after cementless knee arthroplasty. Understanding the critical parameters impacting micromotion is required for optimal implant design, patient selection, and clinical performance. Finite element models have been commonly used to estimate the interface micromotion that cannot be measured directly. However, the micromotion at the tray-bone interface is typically estimated using simplified loading conditions, and the critical tray alignment parameters are unknown. Hence, this project aimed to investigate the influence of the surgical, patient, design factors on interface micromotions in TKA/UKA during a series of activities of daily living.

The [previously validated models] were used to conduct this project.
