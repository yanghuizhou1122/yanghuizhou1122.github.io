**Description:**<br>
Initial fixation of cementless tibial trays after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is crucial to ensure bony ingrowth and long-term fixation. Various implant designs that utilize different features to facilitate this initial stability are currently available. This study aimed to assess the isolated impact of articular conformity and tray features on micromotion during a series of simulated activities, including both cadaveric testing and corresponding computational models.
