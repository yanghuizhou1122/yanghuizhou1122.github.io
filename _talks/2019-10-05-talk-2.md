**Description:**<br>
The bone remodeling process after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is regulated by the changes in tissue strain and strain energy density (SED).  Although recent clinical reports have indicated that tray material is a significant factor in long-term implant fixation, the critical parameters influencing post-operative SED distributions are not well understood.  Hence, the objective of the current study was to investigate the influence of surgical alignment, tray material properties, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) balance, tray posterior slope, and patient anatomy on the proximal tibial bone strain and SED.
