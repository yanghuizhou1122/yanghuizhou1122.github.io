Initial fixation of cementless tibial trays after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is crucial to bony ingrowth. However, interface micromotions cannot typically be directly measured experimentally. Previous studies investigated micromotions at the bone-tray interface via finite element (FE) methods, but few performed validation on cadaveric specimens with physiological loading conditions. Hence, the objective of this study was to develop a validated experimental-computational framework for prediction of tibial micromotion and bone deformation during activities of daily living.
