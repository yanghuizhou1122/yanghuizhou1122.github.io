**Description:**<br>
Initial fixation of cementless tibial trays after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is crucial to bony ingrowth onto the porous surface of the implants, as micromotion magnitudes exceeding 150 Âµm might prevent bone formations and impact implant loosening. Finite element models have been commonly used to estimate the interface micromotion that cannot be measured directly. However, the micromotion at the tray-bone interface is typically estimated using simplified loading conditions, and the critical tray alignment parameters are unknown. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the influences of the tray-bone alignment parameters on interface micromotions during a series of activities of daily living.
