**Description:**<br>
Initial stability of cementless femoral stems after hip revision arthroplasty is crucial to restore hip biomechanics and ensure durable fixation. Various implant designs utilize different features to improve this stability in patients with proximal femoral defects. This study aimed to develop an experimental-computational framework for evaluating the fixation stability of novel cementless hip revision implants during activities of daily living.
