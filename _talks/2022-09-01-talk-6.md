**Description:**<br>
Initial stability of cementless implants after total knee replacement (TKR) is crucial to establish bony ingrowth into the porous interface surface and maintain long-term fixation. Previous studies mainly focused on quantifying tibial micromotion- via experimental or computational methods. However, few investigated the patellar implant micromotion. The goal of this study was to investigate cementless patellar implant micromotion under implant-specific loading conditions and assess the fixation stability for different patellar implant designs.
