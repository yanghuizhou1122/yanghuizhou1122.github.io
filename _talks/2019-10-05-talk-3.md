**Description:**<br>
Improvements in the design of modern cementless patellar implants have sought to mitigate historic failure mechanisms, such as fracture, dissociation of the polyethylene, and aseptic loosening. Understanding the worst-case loading conditions for patellar implant-bone micromotions is critical to evaluate the efficacy of novel patellar implant designs in preventing aseptic loosening. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to develop a patellar micromotion in vitro experiment and corresponding validation of computational models for the prediction of patellar micromotions.
