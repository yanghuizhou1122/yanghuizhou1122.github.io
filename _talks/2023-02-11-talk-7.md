**Description:**<br>
Micromotion exceeding 150Âµm at the implant-bone interface may prevent bone formation and limit fixation after cementless knee arthroplasty. Understanding the critical parameters impacting micromotion is required for optimal implant design, patient selection, and clinical performance. Previous studies commonly use finite element models to estimate tray-bone micromotion and to investigate the micromotion sensitivity of key factors in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, few studies have focused on uni-compartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Hence, this study aimed to investigate the influence of the implant-bone alignment parameters, contact friction, and bone properties on interface micromotions in UKA during a series of activities of daily living.
