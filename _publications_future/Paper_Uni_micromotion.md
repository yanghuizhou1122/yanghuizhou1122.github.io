## Abstract

Micromotion exceeding 150μm at the implant-bone interface may prevent bone formation and limit fixation after cementless knee arthroplasty. Understanding the critical parameters impacting micromotion is required for optimal implant design, patient selection, and clinical performance. However, few studies have focused on unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). In this study, we assessed the impacts of implant alignment, bone properties, and implant design factors on implant-bone (both tibial and femoral) interface micromotions for a novel cementless UKA design during a series of activities of daily living. Three previously validated knee models for predicting cementless micromotions were loaded with design-specific kinematics/loading to simulate gait, deep knee bending, and stair descent. The implant-bone micromotion and the corresponding porous surface area ideal for bone ingrowth (micromotion<50µm) were estimated and compared between different models to quantify the impact of each factor. Overall, the peak tray-bone micromotions (187.3±46.4µm) were consistently found at the lateral aspect of the tibial baseplate and were consistently higher than the peak femoral–bone micromotions (134.5±8.0µm). The femoral micromotion was insensitive to almost all the factors studied, and the minimum ratio of the femoral porous area favorable for bone ingrowth was no less than 93% throughout the activity cycles. Implanting the tray 1mm medially or the femoral component 1mm laterally reduced the tray-bone micromotion by 19.3% and 26.3% respectively. Differences in tray-bone micromotion due to bone moduli were up to 59.8%. The presence of the tray keel prevented the spread of the micromotion and increased the overall porous surface area, although increased the peak micromotion. The tray peg and the femoral anterior peg had no impact on the micromotion of their respective implants. In conclusion, centralizing the load transfer to minimize tibial tray rotation and optimizing the fixation features to minimize micromotion are consistent themes for improving cementless fixation in UKA. Perturbation of femoral-bone alignment may be preferred as it would not create under/overhang on the tibia.
